# Upload data

This guide explains how to upload your experimental data to **ISMapper**. By clicking on *Upload*, you will see a page where you must provide the next information:

- **Title**: you must specify a title for your data. This is useful to differentiate projects.
- **Attach files**: by clicking on the green button, you can select a **fasta** or a **fastq** file from your computer. If your data is too big, you can compress it into a **ZIP** file and select it.
- **Your email** (optional): you can set an email address and we will send you a mail when your data is ready for visualize.

After completing the form, you can click on the **Upload and Run** button for upload your data to the server and start the analysis.

**Important note**: You can create an unlimited number of projects, but every project will only be available over 60 days. After this time, the project will be automatically deleted from our server, and you must upload again your project if you want to continue using our tool.
